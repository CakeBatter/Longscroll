  The idea of the site was to show the growth of a tree as the viewer would scroll the website.<br>
  However, the site itself was going to take way to much time and effort and there were some things that were just in the way.<br>
  So I came with the idea to still show movement with a sparrow flying across the screen.

 The story of this was meant to be a self-interpretation  of what the viwers would think as they would see the sparrow fly.<br>
 I wanted to be able to a lot more to the site as well, but there were many complications to both the CSS and Javascript.

 As for the images and citations, the only thing I used as an image was the sparrow and tree for images.<br>
 The sites for them are https://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-photo-sparrow-flying-animation-sprite-game-image37492205.<br>

 The clouds ended up being made out of css code from this site.http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/pure-css3-animated-clouds-background.
